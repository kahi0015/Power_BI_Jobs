# Power BI Data Jobs

## Introduction

This repository contains the **Power BI Data Jobs Dashboard**, designed to provide insights into data-related tasks and workflows. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, trends, and performance indicators for data jobs, helping to make informed decisions related to job trends.

As a _data professional_, I created this project to showcase my skills in data visualization and dashboard design. The dashboard demonstrates my ability to analyze, present, and communicate data insights effectively using the latest version of Power BI tool (Aug 2025).

The project was developed by following a [video tutorial] authored by _Luke Barousse_ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjaHCVNBWA).
